<p>Here are some of my work experiences:
<br><span id="b">Core Quality Assurance Co-op</span>, Verisk Extreme Event Solutions: <span id="c">January 2024 - June 2024</span>
<br>    Co-op currently in progress.
<br>
<br><span id="b">Intern</span>, GroundBreaking Labs: <span id="c">May 2023 - August 2023</span>
<br> Designed the front end of the company's website and user interface using <span id="b">HTML</span>, <span id="b">CSS</span>, and <span id="b">Vanilla JavaScript</span>.
<br> Leveraged <span id="b">FIGMA</span> to implement animations and <span id="b">increased user retention by 25%</span>.
<br> Used <span id="b">Next.js</span> for back-end implementation, integrating front-end designs with robust server-side logic, database integration, and data processing.
<br> Utilized <span id="b">Node.js</span> and <span id="b">SQL</span> to optimize website performance and enhance data management, reducing loading time by 30% and improving scalability.
<br>
<br><span id="b">Research Assistant</span>, Northeastern University: <span id="c">September 2022 - April 2023</span>
<br> Assisted Professor Robert Platt on “Reinforcement Learning and Robotics”.
<br> Deployed a pathfinder robot in a simulated obstacle course to compare the performance of the epsilon-greedy, softmax, and UCB exploration strategies in relation to exploitation.
<br> Determined how different exploration strategies impact the learning process and the performance of the robot using <span id="b">stable-baselines</span> and <span id="b">PyBullet</span>.
