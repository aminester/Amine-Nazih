# Audio Files Needed

To enable music playback on hover and click for the music vinyl albums, add the following MP3 files to this directory:

## Required Audio Files

1. **gkmc-sample.mp3** - Sample from Kendrick Lamar's "good kid, m.A.A.d city"
2. **igor-sample.mp3** - Sample from Tyler, The Creator's "IGOR"
3. **immunity-sample.mp3** - Sample from Clairo's "Immunity"
4. **die-lit-sample.mp3** - Sample from Playboi Carti's "Die Lit"
5. **heaven-knows-sample.mp3** - Sample from PinkPantheress's "heaven knows"
6. **get-up-sample.mp3** - Sample from NewJeans' "Get Up"
7. **mbdtf-sample.mp3** - Sample from Kanye West's "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"

## Audio Format Guidelines

- **Format**: MP3
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds (to keep file sizes reasonable)
- **Quality**: 128-192 kbps (balance between quality and file size)
- **Content**: Choose memorable sections from the albums

## Notes

- The audio will automatically loop while hovering over the vinyl
- Volume is set to 30% to avoid being too loud
- Audio playback will continue when the modal is open
- Ensure you have rights to use the audio samples or use royalty-free alternatives

## Testing Without Audio Files

The website will work without these audio files - the hover and click functionality will simply not play any sound. You can test the visual aspects of the portfolio without adding the audio files.
